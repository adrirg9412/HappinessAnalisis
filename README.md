# World Happiness Analisis :smile:

_**Everyone is looking for happiness, but in which country is it really found?**_

_This study stems from an activity during my time on the Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the International University of Valencia._

_We are going to analyse each of the factors that can affect the happiness of people living in a country, measuring it on a scale from 0 to 10.
The following factors have been taken into account:_

- _Economy of the country (GDP)._
- _Family and social relations._
- _Life expectancy._
- _Freedom in decision making._
- _Trust in their government._
- _Generosity of people._

_In the course of the study we will try to answer questions that we have been asking ourselves all our lives, such as:_

- _Does money bring happiness?_
- _Are people happier in more developed countries?_
- _Does the government influence people's happiness?_
- _Do health and the economy have something in common?_
- _How does happiness affect people's generosity?_
- _Which country has been the happiest in recent years?_
